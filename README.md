## _War of the Ghosts:_ 
### _the secret histories of Alfred Marshall, F.C. Bartlett, and J.R.R. Tolkien_

An experiment in scholarly composition on github. Project consists of a [Wiki](https://github.com/uoou/WarOfTheGhosts/wiki), a [blog](http://uoou.github.io/WarOfTheGhosts), and (eventually) an ebook (epub, mobi) that can be downloaded as the essay is written.

__Collaborators__: primary researcher: [Simon J. Cook](https://github.com/simonjcook) ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/yemachine)); technical support: [Andrew Holgate](https://github.com/uoou); composition advisor: [Brad Hammer](https://github.com/drbradhammer)

__Expected date of completion__: work to continue over the summer of 2015. It is hoped that an (unfinished) version of the book will be uploaded to the [Rounded Globe](http://roundedglobe.com/books) website sometime in the late summer.

Conclusion

##### Project Aims

Academic disciplinary histories have obscured the intellectual wealth of the recent past, erroneously presenting the 'founders' as doing the same kind of thing as today's practioners. By exploring the (overlooked) historical thought of three major thinkers - Marshall (economics), Bartlett (psychology), and Tolkien (English) - the essay brings to light a now lost rounded globe of knowledge.
