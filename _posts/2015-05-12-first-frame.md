Two angles: space and time.

Space: McDougall does not quite fit anywhere. Ben Shephard, author of the popular book *Headhunters* (2014), observes that McDougall has been airbrushed out of the Cambridge story of the great 1898 Torres Straits expedition and the subsequent histories of Cambridge anthropology and psychology. Does that make him a North American psychologist? It seems that McDougall never quite fit into American society, was always regarded as 'too English'. So he never quite fits anywhere - and yet is the most influential psychologist of his generation. So what is the story? (Is it possible that much that is distinctive about him - and that fits with neither Cambridge nor Harvard, derives from his years at Oxford?)

Time: McDougall seems to speak for a generation that downplayed education. The Engish liberals who steered England out of the Victorian era - I am thinking particularly of J.S. Mill and Alfred Marshall - placed massive emphasis on the ability of education to overcome all individual and social problems. For Mill, education would allow the working class to hold back from rutting like rabbits, and so allow the wage bill to feed into higher individual wages rather than simply more workers. For Marshall, education would raise a citizen body in which all might aspire to be gentlemen, that is, become cultured and autonomous moral agents. 

Then McDougall, with his emphasis on instincts (over Marshall's psychology of habit) develops a psychology of innate differences against which education can do very little. McDougall is in fact very explicit that he is fighting against the older liberal ideas of social progress based on education (I do not understand why he thinks they were so pernicious, but he does.)

And then behaviourism emerges as the dominant school of American psychology for the first part of the twentieth-century, re-introducing, via Pavlov and other Russian physiologists, the notion of habit - but in the form of conditioned reflex. Education thus returns in a big way, except that education is now understood in terms of behavioural conditioning and control.

So how to make sense of the intermediate place occupied and articulated by McDougall?
