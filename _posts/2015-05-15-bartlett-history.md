F. C. Bartlett was too young to join the Cambridge Torres Strait expedition of 1898 (he was only 12). But as the student of W.H.R. Rivers and 
C.S. Myers, he was heir to the combined anthropological and psychological legacy of the expedition. In the first years of his career as a 
Cambridge psychologist, culminating in his first book, *Psychology and Primitive Culture* (1923), Bartlett worked to fashion a psychological theory that could ground the social (and historical) theory of diffusionism that had been but recently developed by various scholars associated with the new Board of Anthropological Studies in Cambridge.

While modern psychology is generally regarded as utterly separate from the study of history, Cambridge psychology from the Torres Straits expedition through to Bartlett's first book was intrinsically historical, albeit in a changing manner. This can be illustrated by contrasting the experiments on sensual capacities performed on the expedition with Bartlett's famous 'war of the ghosts' experiment, which he conducted in the Cambridge psychological laboratory.

In performing experiments on the sensual abilities of the Torres Strait natives, the Cambridge psychologists were testing Herbert Spencer's theory of human evolution. Behind Spencer's theory stood the idea of the human body as an engine with a finite amount of energy. Spencer's ideas was that 'primitive' humans directed most of their limited energy to sensual performance - that is, perceiving subtle differences in their environment, while advanced westerners directed more energy to 'higher' mental functions such as deep thought and aesthetic appreciation - and consequently lost some of their primitive perceptual abilities. 

So testing 'primitive' natives and comparing the results with similar tests on modern Europeans was conceived in historical as much as geographical terms - this was a way of understanding our modern in relation to our primitive selves, with the Torres Strait natives taken as living representatives of prehistoric Europeans.

But finding no clear cut evidence of difference between native and European sensual abilities, the Torres Strait experiments contributed to the dissolution of the evolutionary conception of human history associated with Spencer (and others, such as Tylor and Lubbock). Then, in the decade or so following the expedition, Rivers alongside the Classical Archaeologist William Ridgeway and the Anglo-Saxon scholar H.M. Chadwick in setting up a new faculty of anthropology. By around 1911, Rivers joined Ridgeway and Chadwick in proposing diffusionist explanations of social change, suggesting that, as a general thesis, before positing evolutionary explanations of human history it was necessary to first inquire whether social development might not be the product of the 'contact of peoples'. In a word, just prior to WWI, Cambridge anthropology became the site of a new diffusionist social theory that looked to cultural contact and exchange as the primary engine of social and cultural change.

From the perspective of the new diffusionist social theory of his mentor Rivers, Bartlett's '[war of the ghosts](http://uoou.github.io/WarOfTheGhosts/war-of-the-ghosts/)' experiment - in which a native American Indian folk story was read and then repeated by students in the Cambridge psychological laboratory - is revealed as an experimental investigation into the very warp and weft of history. That is, Bartlett's experiment isolates - and so facilitates analysis of - the basic process of the cultural diffusion of an alien cultural form that is now conceived as the basic motor of history.
