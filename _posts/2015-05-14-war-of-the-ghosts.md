‘The War of the Ghosts’ is a Chinook story, recorded and translated by Franz Boaz (1901, 182-6), and subsequently used in a famous psychology experiment by Bartlett. Here is how Bartlett presented the tale in his report of 1920:

>In *The War of the Ghosts*… two young Indians are seal hunting, when they are accosted by warriors from a canoe, who ask them to help in a fight which is about to take place. One of the Indians agrees, and goes with them. In the fight he hears somebody say: ‘That young Indian has been hit,’ but he feels no hurt. He merely remarks casually: ‘Oh, they are ghosts.’ He goes back home, tells his friends, lights a fire, and the next morning at sunrise falls down: ‘something black came from his mouth. He was dead.’ (Bartlett 1920a, 37.)
 
Bartlett’s experimental subjects were students and teachers of his university. Some read the original story and, after a set interval, repeated it; sometimes to others who in turn repeated it, and so on. The experiment revealed the removal of the mysterious from the story and a gradual process of familiarisation of both details and basic narrative. For example, familiar words were frequently substituted for unfamiliar: ‘canoe’ became ‘boat’, ‘paddling’ became ‘rowing’, and so on. More strikingly, in “every one of the series of reproductions all mention of ghosts drops out almost immediately, and this in spite of the fact that ghosts appear in the original title”. Further modifications followed for, without the ghosts, the painless wound and strange death are left “in the air”. Over a series of reproductions the story was thus reconstructed; for example, by the ninth reproduction a real arrow from another point in the story was said to have hit the Indian, causing an ultimately mortal wound.

Bartlett’s experiment appears to have undergone a similar fate in the telling. Today it is widely discussed (I even found a “re-enactment” on YouTube in which a ten year-old girl recalls the story of ‘The Gift of a Cow Tail Switch’) and invariably presented as a celebrated contribution to the psychology of memory. More involved accounts will typically explain that Bartlett was investigating the effect of mental schema on participants’ recall.  These contemporary story tellers are psychologists of one kind or another, and their presentations mould the experiment to the disciplinarily familiar while occluding the mysterious. 

While Bartlett always understood his experiment to be an exercise in psychology, he presented it originally as a contribution to the study of cultural diffusion. You will find ‘Some Experiments on the Reproduction of Folk-Stories’ in the March 1920 issue of *Folk-Lore*, sandwiched between the Presidential Address to the Folk-Lore Society delivered by A.C. Haddon, Reader of Ethnology at the University of Cambridge, and a paper on ‘The Concept of “Soul-Substance” in New Guinea and Melanesia’ by Rivers.

The 'war of the ghosts' might have been a psychological experiment; but it was a psychological experiment designed to illuminate the workings of cultural diffusion and, thereby, the nature of history.


### Notes

1. In his introduction to his collection of tales Boaz explains that he had two of them – of which one was ‘The War of the Ghosts’ – repeated three and a half years later in order to check the accuracy of his informant, Charles Cultee (Boaz 5). Bartlett does not mention this, but we may surmise that he found this initial repetition a useful check for his own purposes. Bartlett (1920a, 35, note) states that the version of the tale that he used for his experiment was “slightly adapted” from the translation by Boas, but does not elaborate. Comparison shows Bartlett to have censored the description of the death of the Indian at the end of the tale, which in Boas’ versions reads, in the 1891 version: “… something black came out of his mouth and blood came out of his anus. His face became contorted. He was dead” (184); and in the 1894 version: “Blood came out of his mouth, and something black came out of his anus. It was like salad berries” (186).
